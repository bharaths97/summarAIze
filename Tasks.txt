Initial
In Apache HTTP Server 2.4 release 2.4.38 and prior, a race condition in mod_auth_digest when running in a threaded server could allow a user with valid credentials to authenticate using another username, bypassing configured access controlÂ restrictions.

Generated:
In Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.38 and earlier, there's a security flaw in the mod_auth_digest module. This flaw is a race condition that can occur in threaded server setups. It means that a user with valid login credentials might be able to log in as a different user, bypassing the set access controls.
To fix this issue, update the server to a version newer than 2.4.38 where this vulnerability has been addressed.
